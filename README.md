# qPCR_anaylisis

The sets of code provided here are to anaylize data generated from RT-QPCR.
This will take a CSV file with sample names and gene names and calculate the fold changes in mRNA expression. 

The python code is most useful. R is there for scientists more familiar with that language and the C code is for someone looking for less bloat, but it is more particular about the CSV files formatting.
